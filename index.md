### How to add templates

To add a new template to the list you can use **Knowage widget gallery** functionality or use your preferred editor to create a JSON template that will hold all the widget's informations.

Create a folder with the name of the widget you want to add and put it in a folder of the correct category, like:

``` /templates/card/my-custom-widget ```

Remember to add an image of the resulting widget in .jpg or .png format and a [MIT license file](https://github.com/git/git-scm.com/blob/main/MIT-LICENSE.txt) with your name, to keep the template copyright but allowing other community users to use it.

Than you will have to make a pull-request on [this repository](https://github.com/KnowageLabs/knowage-gallery-templates). If you don't know how to do it, just follow [this guideline](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request)!
